        Many <span className="orange">national</span> governments around the
        world are showing themselves to be inefficient and slow-moving in
        response to long-running problems and rapid changes in people's
        underlying needs. In short, many national governments are missing live
        players. Even worse, many of the outside-the-box political ideas that
        are being considered or implemented for national governance today are
        honestly quite terrifying. Do you want the USA to be taken over by a
        clone of WW2-era Portuguese dictator Antonio Salazar, or perhaps an

        <br/>
        <br/>
<p>"American Caesar", to beat down the evil scourge of American leftism?
        For every idea that can be reasonably described as freedom-expanding or
        democratic, there are ten that are just different forms of centralized
        control and walls and universal surveillance. Now consider local</p>
      
        governments.<span className="red">Cities</span> and states, as we've
        seen from the examples at the start of this post, are at least in theory
        capable of genuine dynamism. There are large and very real differences
        of culture between cities, so it's easier to find a single city where
        there is public interest in adopting any particular radical idea than it
        is to convince an entire country to accept it. There are very real
        challenges and opportunities in local public goods, urban planning,
        transportation and many other sectors in the governance of cities that
        could be addressed. Cities have tightly cohesive internal economies
        where things like widespread cryptocurrency adoption could realistically
        independently happen. Furthermore, it's less likely that experiments
        within cities will lead to terrible outcomes both because cities are
        regulated by higher-level governments and because cities have an easier
        escape valve: people who are unhappy with what's going on can more
       <p> easily exit. So all in all, it seems like the local level of government
        is a very undervalued one. And given that criticism of existing smart
        city initiatives often heavily focuses on concerns around centralized
        governance, lack of transparency and data privacy, blockchain and
        cryptographic technologies seem like a promising key ingredient for a

        There are several approaches to scaling blockchains. Some popular approaches include rollups (optimistic and zero knowledge) and parallelizing transaction execution. However, scalability can also be achieved at the consensus level. Let’s explore how we can increase network throughput by using a different underlying data structure for consensus.
What is BFT Consensus?
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus is the ability of a distributed system to agree on an infinite sequence of actions. The underlying goal of BFT consensus is to achieve fault resilience against bad actors or machine failures. In a more formal context, given a network with 
�
n
 participants and 
�
f
 bad actors, how can we agree on an infinite sequence of actions.
