# Electrostatics

 Electrostatics refers to the branch of physics that deals with electric charges at rest and their interactions

### Charge 
Matter is made of a certain elements and particles. With this technological breakthrough, we have discovered hundreds of elemental particles, many of them rare and unimportant to us at this time.

The three most prevalent elementary particles are neutrons, electrons, and photons. Because of their mass these particles attract each other by gravitational forces. Thus an electron attract another electron placed 1 cm away with a gravitational force  $5.5 × 10^{-67}$ and electron is found to repel another electron at 1 cm with a force  $2.3 × 10^{-67}$ this extra force is electric force. 


<!-- $$F = \frac{{k \cdot e^2}}{{r^2}}$$
where:
- **F** is the force of attraction,
- **k** is Coulomb's constant,
- **e** is the charge of an electron,
- **r** is the distance between the electrons. -->

$$F = \frac{{G \cdot Mm}}{{r^2}}$$
where:
- **F** is the force of attraction,
- **k** is Coulomb's constant,
- **e** is the charge of an electron,
- **r** is the distance between the electrons.

Charges are responsible for electrical force, while masses are responsible for gravitational force.

 - Electric force >>> gravitational force (K >> G)
