# How is time travel possible ?

The biggest question in Physics and asked by many people is how time travel is possible ? This is a controversial topic for all. Is it really possible to travel through time or is it only friction for novels and films? Time Travel is used for Rapid journeys around the galaxies or for travel through time. Many people think that nothing like this is possible. This is science fiction or only possible in science fiction movies, but they are totally wrong because Many philosophers and physicists believe that time travel is possible. Steven Hawking says that, today's science fiction is often tomorrow's science fact.

In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus a Renaissance polymath, mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic canon, who formulated a model of the universe that placed the Sun rather than Earth at its center. Detailed his radical theory of the Universe in which the Earth, along with the other planets, rotated around the Sun. Before Copernicus it was believed that Earth is a plane object and the sun and other planets revolve around it. His theory took more than a century to become widely accepted. Earlier, no one had even listened to Copernicus but now we know that the earth and other 7 planets revolve around the sun. Just like that one day people would believe in the theory of time travel.

### How it all started


In 1895 a writer HG Wells wrote about time travel in his groundbreaking novel The Time Machine . It was after this that the phrase time machine became popular.
A machine that can take you into the future as well as the past with it you can travel through time. Although this novel was a science fiction novel but it inspired several philosophers and physicists.
<br>
After this, many films and books were written about time travel or time machines.

### Time travel can be classified in different ways such are
- The first is one way to travel to the future. In this time travel you can go to the future but you can't return back to the present time. Like if you somehow went to the future but you can't come again in the present. It is one sided time travel.
- Instantaneous time jumping. In this kind of time travel one person can jump from one point in time to another intensely using a Time Machine. Like if somehow you travel in time then, you can go to fast or future and even come back to present. It is the best way to travel in time as we can jump in time and also come back to the present. But it is still a matter of battle as to which of these is the best way to travel in time. Well many scientists believe that it is possible if we can travel at the speed of light.
- If a person travels at the speed of light, then time travel is possible. But the speed of light is 299 792 458 m / s and the highest speed of man made object is 244,255 mph which is of NASA solar probe. The world's fastest object ever built as it touches the sun. Fastest human-made object ever whose speed is 244,255 mph (393,044 km/h). We can see the huge difference between the speed of light and solar probes. But one day human beings will break it.
<br>
Oh!! You are thinking I am just talking in air but it is true as we can see our evolution in technology .Technology has advanced so much in the last 50 years. 50 years ago, people did not know the meaning of smartphones or the internet, nor was it possible to make such a thing but now we can't live without them. Our life will be incomplete without the internet or smartphones .That's why this time period is also known as a technology booste . So it is possible that one day we could build such aircrafts that can fly faster or can touch the speed of light.
<br>
When we will reach the speed of light and at that time, time travel is possible.

### There can be two types of time travel

One is to travel into the future and the other is to go back into the past.

### Future time travel 
The scientific explanation and theories of travelling to the future are derived from Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. The concept of time dilation was first introduced by Sir Albert Einstein. Before Einstein it was believed that time is constant whether you are on earth ,space or near black holes time was believed to be something that was constant this statement was given by the most famous physicist and mathematician in the world Sir Isaac Newton. In his opinion, regardless of the speed with which you are travelling through space, regardless of the position, the flow of time would be constant. But Albert Einstein was the first person to refute this statement. He said that Newton was wrong, time isn't constant .Einstein theory of relativity States that time and space are not as constant as everyday life would suggest. He suggested that the only true constant, the speed of light, meant that time can run faster or slower depending on how high you are, and how fast you are travelling. Einstein claimed that time was like a river, like water flows in a river. Sometimes it slows down, sometimes the flow of rivers speeds up, similarly the flow of time sometimes slows down and sometimes it picks up pace depending upon the speed and gravity.
He said that time can actually be sped up and slowed down if the speed and gravitational force could be changed. This is known as time dilation when the speed of an object increases or if an object is subjected to an increased gravitational force .

### Time dilation can be done into different ways
The first with speed. If you are sitting in an object that is going very fast, the faster something goes the more time will slow down for it relative to a person who isn't going fast.
Example suppose you have two Clocks X and Y. I keep one X clock with me and put it on the ground. I send another Y clock with a person on an aeroplane and the aeroplane goes around the earth once and lands back to the earth. If we compare the two clocks' time , the clock shows the same time intensely but now the clock Y that a person took with him in the aeroplane shows a few nanoseconds behind the other clock. The two clocks wouldn't show the same time because one clock was travelling at a higher speed. It's a subjective kinematic time dilation.

There was an experiment in 1971 using two atomic clocks, when one atomic clock was sent in an airplane. It was going round the world and kept another watch on the earth itself. Atomic clocks were used because time was to be measured precisely and it was seen that the clock that was in the aeroplane showed time behind that of the other clock . This was known as the Hafele Keating experiment. This had proved Einstein theory of time dilution.
It doesn't mean that time is actually slowing down for the clock the one in the aeroplane , rather it means that time is relative if we observe the clocks on the aeroplane from the ground times slow down in a relation because we are seeing it, time is slowing down. For a person on the aeroplane for its time, it continued to move as it did.


If we could build a rocket that travels at the speed of light and we get in that rocket and we remain in the rocket for 10 years travelling at the speed of light and again come to earth then the time that we see on earth would be 9000 years later . It's crazy right, but true.
Listing is scientifically possible to do so today but the only problem is that there isn't an aircraft that travels at the speed of light but with improvements in technology we can build more such aircrafts that can fly faster or can touch the speed of light.


A Russian astronaut Gennady Padalka is credited with the most time travels in the future. It is because he remained in space the longest in the world about 879 days and he was travelling at the speed of 28000 km/ hour in space . Accordingly he has travelled 0.02 seconds into the future in comparison to the people on earth he is 0.02 seconds younger.


There is another way of time dilation as let down by Einstein by using gravitational force similarly two time dilation with speed some gravitational force least to time dilation too. The Greater the gravity, the more time dilation would be. The time dilation that takes place because of gravity to visualize it . Einstein asked us to imagine the fabric of space time as you can see in this picture

![space fabric](https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/042617_EC_quantum-equivalence_main_FREE.jpg)

The heavier a ball or in the planetary object would be the more this much would get wrapped. The more mass in the ball or in the planetary object the more would be its gravitational force.

Similarly in the fabric of space time you get to see a curve with the gravitational force of an object. The closer you get to an object with a high gravitational force the more you feel time slows down the time would slow down for you. In this mess you can see the stepper the Drop is the more time slows down for you.

There is a third way of time travelling in the future that is cryosleep.
In this cryosleep people were frozen. They cryosleep for months or years , humans are put into a condition where they don't age their remaining sleep. It sounds like science fiction but in reality NASA is trying to develop a stasis chamber . In it astronauts would be kept in a state of mild hypothermia , in a cold environment astronauts would be able to sleep continuously for two weeks. A hibernation of sorts . The chemical reaction in the body would slow down to quite an extent. This would lead to energy conservation in the body and would Slow Down aging.

Let it be said that we can do time travel and the future but can we do in the past too ?
<br>

### Time travel to past
It is big question but as of now , we can't travel into the past but we can get a glimpse of the past because it takes a significant time for light to travel from one place to another, even with how fast light travels ,if we talk about the distance in light years it takes years for light to travel in some places. So if we could get somewhere before the light reaches there and then look back at the approaching light the light would be from the past that is how we can see the past .

NASA had launched the world's biggest and the most powerful space telescope on 25 December 2021. Its name is James Webb Space Telescope , using this you can get a glimpse of History. Billions of years History can be looked at using this telescope . The
universe began with the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago and this telescope can look till 13 billion years ago . It's possible to see the beginning of the universe.

The most special thing about this telescope is that it has been designed mainly to detect infrared light. When you look at the sky with a normal telescope, you see the wavelength of visible light. The lights that you can see with your naked eyes. That's what electromagnetic spectrum says , the electromagnetic waves in a broad spectrum include X-rays , ultraviolet Rays, radio waves, microwaves and in between there is a small range of visible light , that light that we can see with our naked eyes. Normal telescopes help you look only at the wavelength of visible light. The range of visible light is between blue and red. And red has the biggest wavelength .

![Wave lenght](https://history-computer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shutterstock_514067857-scaled.jpg)

![Electromagnetic radiation](https://cdn.britannica.com/75/95275-050-5FC96002/Radio-waves-rays-light-gamma-ultraviolet-electromagnetic.jpg)

The bigger the wavelength, the easier it is for the electromagnetic waves to pass through any object or obstacle. Like the radio waves . The wavelength of radio waves may span more than kilometres, for this reason you can listen to the radio waves that passed through buildings even. The wavelength of infrared is bigger than that of red but we can't see infrared with a naked eye . The advantage of using a telescope for looking at infrared can be seen in this photo.

![hubble space & James Webb ](https://www.rmg.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/max_width_1440/public/Comparison%20views%20of%20Mystic%20Mountain%20NASA%20ESA%20M.%20Livio%20%26%20Hubble%2020th%20Anniversary%20Team.jpg?itok=qD9P4Br1)

The photo on the left side was taken by the Hubble Space ,Telescope the most powerful space telescope we had till now . You can see the space dust in it and the clouds of gases forming but infrared wavelengths can pass through the dust and clouds will be able to see what lies behind this. And the right picture is what we imagine we would be able to see with the James Webb telescope.
<br>
The word Infrared basically means below red . This word came from Latin .

Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength. Anything that radiates heat, emits infrared waves. animals, the sun ,fire each of these emits infrared waves. That's why in night goggles you would have seen soldiers use night goggles often, they basically detect infrared waves.

![night goggles](https://cdn.eteknix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/maxresdefault1.jpg)
Image taken by night goggles.

Since the telescope will look at stars, galaxies and planets all of which radiate heat so it will be possible to capture and look at infrared waves.

With a telescope, the bigger the mirror they are equipped with the more light they'd be able to capture and the resolution of the image that we get will be that much higher.
That's why the mirror of the James Webb telescope is too big . The entire mirror is plated with 24 karat gold because gold is the best at reflecting red lights.
The sun is very problematic for this telescope as it can only work at the temperature of -223 Celsius. And to avoid the heat of the Sun a sun shield has been installed on this James Webb telescope. For this a very special material has been used that is kaptan.
Because of this telescope the scientists have pinned their hopes that using this ,they would be able to study how stars and Galaxies formed after the Big Bang.

Many people will ask how it is possible to look into the past?
The answer is very simple: the light takes some time to travel the distance and by the time the light reaches from one place to another, a lot of time would have passed.
For example the light from the sun reaches the earth by travelling approximately 8.2 minutes, it means that if the sun vanished suddenly then it would take eight minutes for people to find out on earth . In a way you can say that we are looking eight minutes into the past.
<br>
Similarly apply this logic on a large scale, the stars and Galaxies that are millions of light years away from us, when we look at them through the telescope then we actually see them as they were millions of light years ago

In 2009 Steven Hawking held a party for time Travellers in his college, Gonville and Caius in Cambridge, for a film About Time Travel. To ensure that only genius Time Travel came, he didn't send out the invitation until after the party. On the day of the party he sat in college hoping, but no one came. He was disappointed, but not surprised because he had shown that if general relativity is correct and energy density is possible, time travel is not possible. He would have been delighted if one of his assumptions had turned out to be wrong.This comedy experiment was conducted to prove that it isn't possible to travel to the past.

According to the Einstein theory of relativity in the mesh of space time, if a gravitational force is put on it , that is so heavy that the object falls through the mess then it would create a wormhole like this image.

![Wormhole](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d2SzcBumAfhrjVQHBfpyQh.jpg)

We can use this wormhole to travel into the past. It's said that to do this, we'd need an extremely powerful gravitational field. Similar to one of black holes, perhaps a spinning black hole can generate so much gravitational field that it bands the curvature of space time back on itself. It would create a close time-like curve known as CTC.

### Black holes

black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing – no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light – can escape from it.The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that
event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.

![black hole](https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/08111018/screenshot-2019-04-08-10.24.34.jpg)

Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation of "black hole" as a region of space from which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971.

Black holes of stellar mass form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. Supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses may form by absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies.

Nobel Prize winning physicist Kip Throne believes that small wormholes are created and disappear in space all the time. But they are really small, smaller than atoms and if we want to travel through them then we would need to open them somehow. It would take a lot of energy to expand them. Not only normal energy, but we would need negative energy also. Negative energy is a kind of anti gravitational energy, that would repel the fabric of space time like the same poles of magnet repel each other. Negative energy would work in the same way to repel it.
<br>
That would make it possible to keep the wormhole for a long time and travel through it.

It might be theoretically possible to travel to the past, but when we talk about travelling to the past there are a lot of hurdles. There are many obstacles for us. I am talking about paradoxus.

Example grandfather paradox. The paradox goes like this, suppose I go to the past while time travelling and I killed my great-grandfather. If he dies, how would I be born? If my great-grandfather died, I wouldn't be alive and if I was never born, I never existed. How could I have gone to the past and killed him? Either I am alive or I am not. There are some theories to explain this, Such as the theory of the multiverse. The theory claims that what happened once was in one universe, but when you travel back in time and change something it would create a new universe. So there are multiple universes with different things happening. Related to this there is another Paradox, the predestination paradox. It claims that when I'd go into the past, and do whatever, everything I do shapes my present timeline. It states that things are destined to turn out in a certain way. Things will play out as written in our destiny. No matter how much you try to change the past, whatever you try to change and the result of that change would be your present.
It is too complex but we can understand it by an example. Suppose that tomorrow is your exam and you were sleeping all day and haven't studied anything all day and because of it you got less Marks in your exams. And somehow you go to the past and you went on the same day and picked yourself up and said to study. But you see again that because of you, you sleep and you could not read.

> Overall there would be many logical problems when time travelling to the past, there would be paradoxes. Due to these, It may never be possible but travelling to the future is possible, even today and it will become more and more probable in future and to get a glimpse of the past, is currently possible too. So in a sense, Time Travel already exists.
